Hello, I'm petally (also known as levs), and I like programming.
Things that interest me include physics, and multiplayer in games.
My big inspirations are:
- Cortex Command
- Noita
- Worms
- Liero

Currently, I'm working on learning some web development stuff. After I'm done with that, I think I'll try to dive into some C programming.
I also develop on Roblox.
